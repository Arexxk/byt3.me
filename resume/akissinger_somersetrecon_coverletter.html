              <br>Dear Mr. Jordan:</br>
              <br>
I have the ability to make your acquaintance through Mr. David Kohlbrenner, who has recommended me to contact you regarding opportunities at your company.
I have always desired to work in computer and hardware security and would like to learn how to intercept data and manipulate systems to reflect desired behavior.
I would like to meet with you to share my personal and academic experiences and how they have prepared me to be a valuable part of your team.
              </br>
              <br>
As my resume indicates, I not only have a strong foundation software engineering and IT operations, but I also possess an understanding in security and electronics.
I believe that personal projects are my form of expression in these interests.
MalBot!, the ninja WIFI hacking robot, could autonomously search for WIFI APs, find dark areas to hide, and perform scripted attacks against a network.
Building the robot required designing circuits, interfacing with them via GPIO and SPI, and writing scripts to bring it all together.
Project XI, the open-source car project, aimed to centralize, and control, all of the electrical functions of a car from an iPad.
It required analyzing leaked service manuals, understanding I2C and serial protocols, parsing and fuzzing CAN messages, and even modifying hardware.
There are many more projects that I would like to share with you in person, including research I recently started at UCSD in weaponizing DRAM disturbance errors.
              </br>
              <br>
My experience with research and research related projects has given me the ability to be self-reliant, team-oriented, and a powerful willingness to learn, which I view as my greatest asset.
              </br>
              <br>
Attached with this letter is my resume. I truly look forward to hearing from you soon.
              </br>
              <br>Sincerely,</br>
              <br>Alexander N. Kissinger</br>
