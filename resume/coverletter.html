              <br>To Whom It May Concern:</br>
              <br>

I am a young professional seeking opportunities in the industry.
Upon reviewing job vacancies in your company, I am pleased to discover the opening as a ____ and would like to extend my interest that position.
              </br>
              <br>
Attending UC San Diego exposed me to many fields of computer science, ranging from front-end web development to computer architecture and design. 
During this time, I naturally gravitated towards networking, operating systems, and security. 
Realizing my interests I attempted to build my experience through classes, research, and summer internship positions.
Projects such as developing a user-level threading library, implementing a simple router, and designing a ROP exploit were among my favorites because they disambiguated many concepts about technology, which I considered mysteries.
Performing research at the San Diego Supercomputer Center was one of my greatest experiences.
I was tasked with parallel programing, cluster design, systems engineering, and devops.
However, I also enjoy exploring the artistic side of software development. 
Working at Calit2 and Xpenser gave me the opportunity to contribute to large iOS and Django applications.
While at Akamai, I learned how to prototype smaller projects in Javascript and HTML5.
The last project I have at UC San Diego consists of security research for the UC San Diego CSE Department.
I hope it will be an enriching experience.

My experience with research and project-based education has left me with useful critical analysis skills and the ability to pursue solutions on my own.
However, I am personable and work extremely well in cross-functional team environments.
But most importantly, I have a high willingness to learn and prove myself in this field.
This I why I believe that I would be an asset your company.

Attached with this letter is my resume summarizing my relevant industry experience, projects I feel proud about sharing, and research I have contributed or am currently contributing to.
If you have any questions, such as source code to my projects, you can find my contact information on this document.
Thank you for your time, and I hope to hear back from you soon.
              </br>
              <br>Sincerely,</br>
              <br>Alexander N. Kissinger</br>
